Wanted to make something cool, practical, and challenging to put what we've been learning to use.

Send Max your github username if you want to be added as a collaborator :)

Notes:

the Javascript components (lowercase-c) are really just suggestions, feel free to
write your code in one file if that's more comfortable, or you can modularize them even more.

I linked to jQuery in the html header if you want to play around with that

And if you figure out or do something cool, share it in the README or Slack :)
