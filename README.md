Send Max your github username if you want to be added as a collaborator :)

Notes:

the Javascript components (lowercase-c) are really just suggestions, feel free to
write your code in one file if that's more comfortable, or you can modularize them even more.

I linked to jQuery in the html header if you want to play around with that

And if you figure out or do something cool, share it in the README or Slack :)

*** For sharing in the Readme, pull it from the origin main and then push the changes you
made to the README ONLY (be careful that you don't push your entire solution) to the main branch. If you do though it'll be fine, we'll figure out how to fix it :) ***
